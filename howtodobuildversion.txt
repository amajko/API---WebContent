David,
it's not directly available as an option, but is easy to do:
Please add a custom ANT builder, and create a build.xml file that will 
call BuildNumber task. This task will store build number in a properties 
file and update it every time it's called. If you want the build number 
to be increased every time, Eclipse performs build (eg. every file 
save), you also have to indicate this in builder options.
Finally properties file can be included in your .jar file or anywhere 
you want and accessed like any other properties.

In your project properties, on Builders tab add new builder, choose Ant 
Build, and choose your Build file.

build.xml might look like:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="project" default="default">
<target name="default">
<buildnumber file="file.with.buildnumber.properies"/>
</target>
</project>



Please let me know if you have any further questions.


that file will now be in WebContent/WEB-INF/file.with.buildnumber.properies in the exploded war file in webapps
